          <h3>Trivia for Coffee</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15%">
            Coffee beans are actually seeds: The coffee "bean" is the pit or
            seed of a bright red or purple fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee
            is one of the most traded commodities: It is second only to oil in
            terms of its global economic importance. The word "coffee" has
            various origins: The word "coffee" is believed to have originated
            from the Arabic word "qahwah" or the Turkish word "kahve." Coffee
            was discovered in Ethiopia: According to legend, coffee was
            discovered by a goat herder named Kaldi in Ethiopia in the 9th
            century. He noticed that his goats became energetic after eating the
            berries from a certain tree. Brazil is the world's largest producer:
            Brazil is the largest producer of coffee, responsible for about
            one-third of the world's total coffee supply. Espresso is not a type
            of coffee bean: Espresso is a brewing method, not a type of coffee
            bean. It is made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee
            under high pressure.

        <h3>Trivia for Milktea</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15%">
          Origin of milk tea: Milk tea, also known as bubble tea or boba tea,
          originated in Taiwan in the 1980s. It was created as a variation of
          traditional Taiwanese tea by adding milk and tapioca pearls. Tapioca
          pearls: The signature element of milk tea is the tapioca pearls, also
          known as boba. These small, chewy balls are made from tapioca starch
          and are typically added to the tea for a unique texture and flavor.
          Varieties of milk tea: Milk tea comes in a variety of flavors and
          types. Some popular options include classic milk tea, matcha milk tea,
          taro milk tea, and fruit-flavored milk tea. Bubble tea's popularity:
          Milk tea has gained immense popularity worldwide, especially among
          younger generations. It has become a trendy and widely consumed
          beverage in many countries.

        <h3>Trivia for Corndog</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15%">
          Invention of the corndog: The corndog, also known as a corn dog or a
          Pronto Pup, is believed to have been invented in the United States.
          Its exact origin is disputed, but it is often credited to two men:
          George F. N. McFarland and Carl and Neil Fletcher. They independently
          introduced the corndog at the Texas State Fair and the Iowa State
          Fair, respectively, in the 1940s. The corndog's batter: The
          traditional corndog batter is made by combining cornmeal, flour,
          sugar, salt, and buttermilk. The hot dog is skewered with a stick,
          dipped in the batter, and deep-fried until golden brown. Popular fair
          food: Corndogs are commonly associated with fairs, carnivals, and
          amusement parks. They have become a classic staple of fairground
          cuisine and are enjoyed by people of all ages. International
          variations: While corndogs are most commonly associated with the
          United States, variations of this deep-fried treat can be found in
          different parts of the world. For example, in South Korea, there is a
          popular street food called "hotteok," which is a sweet pancake filled
          with ingredients like sugar, cinnamon, and nuts, and can also include
          a hot dog.
